# ember-f-s-w-t

Ensure always up to date. Ember from scratch with testing.
</b>The first three projects that I tried to clone and run did not work out of the box ...

I will be working using [npm-check-updates](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16074029/5283424).
<br/>The goal being do not even let major verions stop you from upgrading. Always be bleeding edge.
<br/>However, this will be a lot of manual upgrading.
<br/>I will script the npm-check-updates to change the package json to the * syntax and run the command automatically.

I plan to integrate another project that is still very much in beta [under the dome](https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/under_the_dome)
<br/>[under the dome](https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/under_the_dome) has a dependency of good testing in order to work.

Hopefully all goes well ðŸ˜‹  .

This project should help with that. 
I will have a package-lock branch. 
All package-lock branches are gaurenteed to work.
